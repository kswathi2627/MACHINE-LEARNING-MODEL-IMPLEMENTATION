#DESCRIPTION

This project implements a machine learning predictive model using Scikit-Learn to classify SMS messages as spam or ham (not spam). The dataset is preprocessed using TF-IDF vectorization to convert text into numerical features. A Naive Bayes classifier is trained on the data and evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report. The model achieves high accuracy and can successfully predict whether a message is spam or not.
The workflow includes:

Data Preprocessing – Cleaning and preparing the dataset by encoding labels and converting text into numerical features using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).

Model Training – Applying the Naive Bayes classifier, which is efficient and widely used for text classification problems.

Evaluation – Assessing performance using accuracy score, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Prediction – Testing the model with custom messages to verify real-time predictions.

The model achieves high accuracy (95%+), demonstrating its effectiveness in filtering unwanted spam messages. This project showcases the complete machine learning pipeline from data preprocessing to model deployment and can be extended with advanced NLP or deep learning techniques for improved performance.
